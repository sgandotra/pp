NMON Overview:
The nmon tool is designed for AIX and Linux performance specialists to use for monitoring and analyzing performance data,
including:
	- CPU utilization
	- Memory use
	- Kernel statistics and run queue information
	- Disks I/O rates, transfers, and read/write ratios
	- Free space on file systems
	- Disk adapters
	- Network I/O rates, transfers, and read/write ratios
	- Paging space and paging rates
	- CPU and AIX specification
	- Top processors
	- User-defined disk groups
	- Machine details and resources
	- Network File System (NFS)

PayPal Adaptation:
NMON is made available to work stand-alone, or in conjunction with other projects hosted in this repository to
invoke NMON on a remote stage from a test automation script, and to build HTML reports from the raw results
which can be generated from within a Fusion job or some other mechanism.

Scripts:
The following included scripts are needed to use nmon within a test automation framework.  They should live
in the same NMON_HOME path as the nmon binary.

 - clean.sh <directory> - cleans the results by removing a directory relative to NMON_HOME
    example invocation:	clean.sh data/test-123
 	
 - run.sh <samples> <frequency (secs)> [output directory]
 	example invocation (10 samples at 6 sec intervals): nmon 10 6 data/nmon-1-minute-performance
 	
 - stop.sh: stops all nmon binaries running on the system
